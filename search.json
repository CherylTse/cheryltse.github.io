This paper proposes GBG++, a fast and stable granular ball generation method based on the attention mechanism. The proposed method only needs to calculate distances from the data-driven center to undivided samples when splitting each granular ball, significantly improving both stability and efficiency compared to existing GBG methods.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link🐙 Code Link\n","tags":["paper"]},{"title":"GBABS","url":"/2025/12/19/GBABS/","content":""},{"title":"Hello World","url":"/2025/12/18/hello-world/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
