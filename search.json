[{"title":"GAdaBoost: An Efficient and Robust AdaBoost Algorithm Based on Granular-Ball Structure","url":"/2025/12/19/GAdaBoost/","content":"Knowledge-Based Systems, 2025\n\n\nAbstarctAdaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Inspired by granular computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link: KBS🐙 Code Link: GAdaBoost\n","categories":["publication"],"tags":["paper"]},{"title":"Approximate Borderline Sampling using Granular-Ball for Classification Tasks","url":"/2025/12/19/GBABS/","content":"IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), 2025\n\n\nAbstarctThis paper proposes an approximate borderline sampling method using granular-balls for classification tasks. First, a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed to prevent GB overlaps through constrained expansion. Second, based on the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbors, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling (GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link: IEEE ICDE🐙 Code Link: GBABS\n","categories":["publication"],"tags":["paper"]},{"title":"GBG++: A Fast and Stable Granular Ball Generation Method for Classification","url":"/2025/12/18/GBG/","content":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, 2024\n\n\nAbstarctGranular ball computing (GBC) is an efficient, robust, and scalable learning method that has become a popular research topic of granular computing. This paper proposes GBG++, a fast and stable granular ball generation method based on the attention mechanism. The proposed method only needs to calculate distances from the data-driven center to undivided samples when splitting each granular ball, significantly improving both stability and efficiency compared to existing GBG methods.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link: IEEE TETCI🐙 Code Link: GBG-plusplus\n","categories":["publication"],"tags":["paper"]},{"title":"Adaptive Three-Way Spam Filter Based on Similarity Measurement","url":"/2025/12/19/SpamFilter/","content":"计算机研究与发展, 2019\n\n\nAbstarctThis paper presents an adaptive three-way spam filter based on similarity measurement. By combining three-way decision theory with similarity-based learning, the proposed filter provides an effective approach for spam email classification. The adaptive mechanism allows the system to dynamically adjust its decision boundaries based on the characteristics of incoming emails, improving both accuracy and robustness in spam detection tasks.\nSource📄 Paper Link: 计研发\n","categories":["publication"],"tags":["paper"]},{"title":"A Novel Three-way decision model with decision-theoretic rough sets using utility theory","url":"/2025/12/19/3WD-utility/","content":"Knowledge-Based Systems, 2018\n\n\nAbstarctThis paper proposes a novel three-way decision model that integrates decision-theoretic rough sets with utility theory. By incorporating utility functions into the decision-making process, the model provides a more flexible and comprehensive framework for handling uncertainty in classification tasks. The approach extends traditional three-way decision models by considering the utility of different decision outcomes, enabling more nuanced and context-aware decision-making strategies.\nSource📄 Paper Link: KBS\n","categories":["publication"],"tags":["paper"]},{"title":"Three-Way Hybrid Sampling Using Granular Balls for Imbalanced Classiﬁcation","url":"/2025/12/19/TWHGBS/","content":"International Joint Conference on Rough Sets (IJCRS), 2024\n\n\nAbstarctThis paper proposes a three-way hybrid sampling method using granular balls to address imbalanced classification problems.
