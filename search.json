Inspired by granular computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link: KBS🐙 Code Link: GAdaBoost\n"},{"title":"GBG++: A Fast and Stable Granular Ball Generation Method for Classification","url":"/2025/12/18/GBG/","content":"PublicationIEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, 2024\nAbstarctGranular ball computing (GBC) is an efficient, robust, and scalable learning method that has become a popular research topic of granular computing. This paper proposes GBG++, a fast and stable granular ball generation method based on the attention mechanism. The proposed method only needs to calculate distances from the data-driven center to undivided samples when splitting each granular ball, significantly improving both stability and efficiency compared to existing GBG methods.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link: IEEE TETCI🐙 Code Link: GBG-plusplus\n","tags":["paper"]},{"title":"Hello World","url":"/2025/12/18/hello-world/","content":"Welcome to Hexo!

First, a restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed to prevent GB overlaps through constrained expansion. Second, based on the concept of heterogeneous nearest neighbors, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling (GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.\nArchiteture\n\nSource📄 Paper Link: IEEE ICDE🐙 Code Link: GBABS\n","tags":["paper"]}]
